However, you will be creating a separate Git repository to submit your answers.\n\n* Start by forking this repository to your own GitHub account.\n* In your Cloud9, move to your home directory and clone your fork of the repository\n* You will be doing most of your work inside this cloned, empty repo\n\n## History\n * Create a branch `cmd-history` off of `master`\n * Create a file called `history.txt` that contains all your history so far\n * Add and commit this file to Git\n * Push the branch to GitHub and create a pull request to submit your answer\n\n## Searching for files\n * Create a branch called `finding-files` off of `master`\n * Find all the files in the DecodeMTL project that have the word \"logo\" in the file name\n * Take the output of the command to a file called `files-with-logo.txt`\n * Add/commit that file to Git\n * Find all the files in the DecodeMTL project that are over 500KB\n * Take the output of the command to a file called `files-over-500kb.txt`\n * Add/commit that file to Git\n * Push the branch to GitHub and create a pull request to submit your answer\n\n## Searching for content in files\n * Create a branch called `finding-content` off of `master`\n * Find all the files in the DecodeMTL project that contain the word \"javascript\"\n * Take the output of the command to a file called `files-with-javascript.txt`\n * Add/commit that file to Git\n * Do the same thing you did, but adding the line numbers to the found files\n * Take the output of the command to a file called `files-with-javascript-numbers.txt`\n * Using the manual page, figure out how to only output the file names **only** rather than the content\n * Take the output of that new command to a file called `filenames-with-javascript.txt`\n * Add/commit that file to Git\n * Push the branch to GitHub and create a pull request to submit your answer\n\n## Pipes and redirection\n * Create a branch called `pipes-and-redirection`\n * Install the command-line application called `fortune`\n * Try running the `fortune` application by itself\n * Read the manual page for the `fortune` application to see if you can do anything fun with it\n * Run the fortune application again and send its output to a file called `fortune.txt`\n * Using the `tr` command (you'll have to read the manual page), see if you can replace all instances of the letter `e` with an underscore `_` in the `fortune .txt` file\n * Again, using the `tr` command, send its output to a file called `fortune-replaced.txt`\n * Using a combination of `fortune` and `cowsay`, try to make the cow say a fortune\n * Take the output of the cow saying its fortune to a file called `cow-fortune.txt`\n * Add/commit all your files\n * Push the branch to GitHub and create a pull request to submit your answer\n\n## Advanced pipes and redirection\n * Learn more about the `sort` command\n * Learn more about the `uniq` command\n * Learn more about the `wc` command\n * Using one of the previous commands, count the number of words in the `poem.txt` file and send that to a file called `poem-words.txt`\n * Using one of the previous commands, count the number of lines in the `poem.txt` file and send that to a file called `poem-lines.txt`\n * Sort the `poem.txt` file in alphabetical order, and send this output to `poem-sorted.txt`\n * Create a file called `poem-unique.txt` that contains the sorted poem, but without duplicate lines\n * Create a file called `poem-popular.txt` that contains the lines of the poem sorted in the order they appear most often\n * Create a file called `poem-hipster.txt` that contains **ONLY** the lines that appear once in the poem\n","undoManager":{"mark":-2,"position":15,"stack":[[{"start":{"row":0,"column":0},"end":{"row":0,"column":1},"action":"insert","lines":["a"],"id":2}],[{"start":{"row":0,"column":1},"end":{"row":0,"column":2},"action":"insert","lines":["d"],"id":3}],[{"start":{"row":0,"column":2},"end":{"row":0,"column":3},"action":"insert","lines":["g"],"id":4}],[{"start":{"row":0,"column":3},"end":{"row":0,"column":4},"action":"insert","lines":["i"],"id":5}],[{"start":{"row":0,"column":4},"end":{"row":0,"column":5},"action":"insert","lines":["t"],"id":6}],[{"start":{"row":0,"column":5},"end":{"row":0,"column":6},"action":"insert","lines":["

However, you will be creating a separate Git repository to submit your answers.\n\n* Start by forking this repository to your own GitHub account.\n* In your Cloud9, move to your home directory and clone your fork of the repository\n* You will be doing most of your work inside this cloned, empty repo\n\n## History\n * Create a branch `cmd-history` off of `master`\n * Create a file called `history.txt` that contains all your history so far\n * Add and commit this file to Git\n * Push the branch to GitHub and create a pull request to submit your answer\n\n## Searching for files\n * Create a branch called `finding-files` off of `master`\n * Find all the files in the DecodeMTL project that have the word \"logo\" in the file name\n * Take the output of the command to a file called `files-with-logo.txt`\n * Add/commit that file to Git\n * Find all the files in the DecodeMTL project that are over 500KB\n * Take the output of the command to a file called `files-over-500kb.txt`\n * Add/commit that file to Git\n * Push the branch to GitHub and create a pull request to submit your answer\n\n## Searching for content in files\n * Create a branch called `finding-content` off of `master`\n * Find all the files in the DecodeMTL project that contain the word \"javascript\"\n * Take the output of the command to a file called `files-with-javascript.txt`\n * Add/commit that file to Git\n * Do the same thing you did, but adding the line numbers to the found files\n * Take the output of the command to a file called `files-with-javascript-numbers.txt`\n * Using the manual page, figure out how to only output the file names **only** rather than the content\n * Take the output of that new command to a file called `filenames-with-javascript.txt`\n * Add/commit that file to Git\n * Push the branch to GitHub and create a pull request to submit your answer\n\n## Pipes and redirection\n * Create a branch called `pipes-and-redirection`\n * Install the command-line application called `fortune`\n * Try running the `fortune` application by itself\n * Read the manual page for the `fortune` application to see if you can do anything fun with it\n * Run the fortune application again and send its output to a file called `fortune.txt`\n * Using the `tr` command (you'll have to read the manual page), see if you can replace all instances of the letter `e` with an underscore `_` in the `fortune .txt` file\n * Again, using the `tr` command, send its output to a file called `fortune-replaced.txt`\n * Using a combination of `fortune` and `cowsay`, try to make the cow say a fortune\n * Take the output of the cow saying its fortune to a file called `cow-fortune.txt`\n * Add/commit all your files\n * Push the branch to GitHub and create a pull request to submit your answer\n\n## Advanced pipes and redirection\n * Learn more about the `sort` command\n * Learn more about the `uniq` command\n * Learn more about the `wc` command\n * Using one of the previous commands, count the number of words in the `poem.txt` file and send that to a file called `poem-words.txt`\n * Using one of the previous commands, count the number of lines in the `poem.txt` file and send that to a file called `poem-lines.txt`\n * Sort the `poem.txt` file in alphabetical order, and send this output to `poem-sorted.txt`\n * Create a file called `poem-unique.txt` that contains the sorted poem, but without duplicate lines\n * Create a file called `poem-popular.txt` that contains the lines of the poem sorted in the order they appear most often\n * Create a file called `poem-hipster.txt` that contains **ONLY** the lines that appear once in the poem\n","undoManager":{"mark":-2,"position":15,"stack":[[{"start":{"row":0,"column":0},"end":{"row":0,"column":1},"action":"insert","lines":["a"],"id":2}],[{"start":{"row":0,"column":1},"end":{"row":0,"column":2},"action":"insert","lines":["d"],"id":3}],[{"start":{"row":0,"column":2},"end":{"row":0,"column":3},"action":"insert","lines":["g"],"id":4}],[{"start":{"row":0,"column":3},"end":{"row":0,"column":4},"action":"insert","lines":["i"],"id":5}],[{"start":{"row":0,"column":4},"end":{"row":0,"column":5},"action":"insert","lines":["t"],"id":6}],[{"start":{"row":0,"column":5},"end":{"row":0,"column":6},"action":"insert","lines":["
